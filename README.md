## My Role

Designer · Developer

I designed and built the app and backend myself.

## Why I Built This

I built Strivvy because I share a lot of links with friends and family, so I wanted a service that catered to that.
Using Instagram as inspiration, I wanted to see what a social link sharing app would be like.
