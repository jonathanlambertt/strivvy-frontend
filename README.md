## My Role

Designer · Developer

I designed and built the app and backend myself.

## Why I Built This

I built Strivvy because I share a lot of links with friends and family, so I wanted a service that catered to that.
Using Instagram as inspiration, I wanted to see what a social link sharing app would be like.

## What I Focused On

I had 3 goals when building Strivvy:

1. Create visually pleasant link previews.
2. Make sharing links fast and low-friction.
3. Support sharing links outside the app, and ensure tapping a preview opens the content in the appropriate app.

### Visually pleasant link previews

I wanted full control over how links were presented, so I wrote my own previewer. The layout emphasizes imagery while
still providing enough context so users can quickly understand what the link is about.
