## My Role

Designer · Developer

I designed and built the app and backend myself.

## Why I Built This

I built Strivvy because I share a lot of links with friends and family, so I wanted a service that catered to that.
Using Instagram as inspiration, I wanted to see what a social link sharing app would be like.

## What I Focused On

I had 3 goals when building Strivvy:

### 1. Visually pleasant link previews

I wanted full control over how links were presented, so I wrote my own previewer. The layout emphasizes imagery while
still providing enough context so users can quickly understand what the link is about.

### 2. Fast and low-friction link sharing

When sharing a link, Strivvy checks whether a link has been copied and displays a “Paste from clipboard” button to allow for easy input.

### 3. Seamless sharing and link opening across apps

You can share links you see in your feed outside the app by tapping “Share” under the preview and copying the link. Tapping a preview will open 
the content in its respective app. For example, a song on Spotify will open in Spotify.
