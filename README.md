# Strivvy · A social link sharing app

Strivvy is a personal project exploring what social link sharing might feel like if links were treated as the primary content.

## My Role

Developer · Designer

I designed and built both the app and its [backend](https://github.com/jonathanlambertt/strivvy-backend).

## Why I Built This

I built Strivvy because I often share links with friends and family, and wanted a service that better supported that behavior. 
Using Instagram as inspiration, I wanted to explore what a social link-sharing app might feel like.

## What I Focused On

I had three goals when building Strivvy:

### 1. Visually pleasant link previews

I wanted full control over how links were presented, so I wrote my own previewer. The layout emphasizes imagery while
still providing enough context so users can quickly understand what the link is about.

### 2. Fast and low-friction link sharing

When sharing a link, Strivvy checks whether a link has been copied and displays a “Paste from clipboard” button to allow for easy input.

### 3. Seamless sharing and link opening across apps

You can share links you see in your feed outside the app by tapping “Share” under the preview and copying the link. Tapping a preview will open 
the content in its respective app. For example, a song on Spotify will open in Spotify.

## What the App Supports
- Creating an account and following friends
- Sharing links through a social feed
- Viewing rich link previews
- Liking and sharing posts
